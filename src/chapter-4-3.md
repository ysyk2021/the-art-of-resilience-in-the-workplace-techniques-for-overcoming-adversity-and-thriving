Building resilience requires a proactive and intentional approach. Strategies for building resilience may include developing a growth mindset, practicing self-care, cultivating strong relationships, seeking out new experiences, and taking calculated risks. Leaders can also play a critical role in fostering resilience by promoting a supportive and inclusive culture, providing opportunities for growth and development, and modeling resilience in the face of adversity.

Measuring Resilience

Measuring resilience can be challenging, as it is a complex and multifaceted trait. However, there are several tools and assessments that can be used to measure resilience in individuals and organizations.
